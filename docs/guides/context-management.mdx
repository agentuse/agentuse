title: Context Management  
description: How AgentUse manages conversation context efficiently
---

## Overview

AgentUse automatically manages conversation context to keep your agents running efficiently within token limits. This ensures long-running agents don't hit token limits while preserving important information.

## Automatic Compaction

When conversations approach token limits, AgentUse automatically:
1. Detects when context usage exceeds the threshold
2. Compacts older messages into a concise summary
3. Preserves recent messages for continuity
4. Continues the conversation seamlessly

<Info>
  Compaction happens transparently - your agent continues working without interruption.
</Info>

## How It Works

### Token Tracking

AgentUse tracks token usage throughout the conversation and compacts when approaching limits. The system uses character-based estimation (approximately 4 characters per token) and updates with actual usage data from the AI models.

### Compaction Strategy

AgentUse uses a **summarization-based** approach:
- Older messages are summarized using the same model as the agent
- Recent messages are preserved intact for continuity
- The summary captures key decisions, tool results, and progress
- System prompts and tool definitions are always preserved

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Control context management globally using environment variables:

```bash
# Enable/disable context compaction (default: enabled)
CONTEXT_COMPACTION=true

# Set compaction threshold as percentage (default: 0.7 = 70%)
COMPACTION_THRESHOLD=0.8

# Number of recent messages to preserve (default: 3)
COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT=5

# Maximum agent steps before stopping (default: 1000)
MAX_STEPS=2000
```

## What Gets Preserved

### Always Preserved

- System prompts
- Recent messages (last 3 by default, configurable)
- Tool definitions remain available

### What Gets Compacted

- Older conversation history
- Previous tool calls and results
- Assistant responses from earlier in the conversation

The compaction creates a summary that preserves:
- Key decisions and outcomes
- Important tool results and errors
- Current state and progress
- Critical information needed for continuation

## Compaction Details

### Compaction Process

When compaction is triggered:
1. Older messages are separated from recent ones
2. A summarization request is sent to the same model
3. The summary is created with a specialized system prompt
4. Recent messages are kept intact for continuity
5. The conversation continues with the compacted context

### Compaction Prompt

The system uses this prompt for summarization:
```
You are a conversation summarizer. Summarize the following agent context concisely, preserving:
1. Key decisions and outcomes
2. Important tool results and errors
3. Current state and progress
4. Any critical information needed for continuation

Be concise but comprehensive.
```

## Monitoring

### Token Usage

AgentUse displays token usage at the end of each run:
```
Tokens used: 12,450
```

For agents with sub-agents:
```
Tokens used: 18,750 (main: 12,450, sub-agents: 6,300)
```

### Compaction Events

When compaction occurs, you'll see:
```
Context approaching limit (85% used). Compacting agent context...
Context compacted successfully. Continuing...
```

## Context Limits by Model

AgentUse automatically detects context limits for different models:

- **Anthropic models**: Retrieved from models.dev API
- **OpenAI models**: Retrieved from models.dev API  
- **Unknown models**: Default to 32,000 tokens (conservative)

The system updates context limits dynamically based on the latest model information.

## Performance Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Compaction Overhead">
    Compaction requires an additional API call to summarize context, adding 1-3 seconds to processing time
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token Usage">
    Compaction itself uses tokens (up to 2000 for the summary), but saves significantly more in long conversations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context Quality">
    Summaries preserve key information but some nuance may be lost. Recent messages remain fully intact
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### 1. Set Appropriate Thresholds

```bash
# Conservative (compact early, better context preservation)
COMPACTION_THRESHOLD=0.6

# Aggressive (compact late, more context before compaction)
COMPACTION_THRESHOLD=0.9

# Balanced (recommended default)
COMPACTION_THRESHOLD=0.7
```

### 2. Adjust Recent Messages

```bash
# Keep more recent messages (better continuity, more tokens used)
COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT=5

# Keep fewer recent messages (more aggressive compaction)
COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT=2
```

### 3. Disable if Not Needed

```bash
# Disable for short conversations
CONTEXT_COMPACTION=false
```

## Technical Details

### Token Estimation

- Uses character-based estimation: ~4 characters per token
- Updates with actual token usage from AI models
- Tracks both input and output tokens

### Model Integration

- Context limits are fetched from models.dev API
- Falls back to conservative 32,000 token limit for unknown models
- Caches model information for 24 hours

### Error Handling

- If compaction fails, creates a fallback summary
- Continues execution even if compaction encounters errors
- Logs compaction failures for debugging

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context Lost After Compaction">
    - Increase `COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT` for more preserved messages
    - Lower `COMPACTION_THRESHOLD` to compact earlier with more context
    - The same model is used for summarization, so quality should be consistent
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hitting Token Limits">
    - Lower `COMPACTION_THRESHOLD` to compact earlier
    - Reduce `COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT` for more aggressive compaction
    - Consider the model's actual context limit vs your usage
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compaction Not Working">
    - Check that `CONTEXT_COMPACTION` is not set to 'false'
    - Verify the model supports the context limits being used
    - Check logs for compaction errors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Long-Running Agent

```yaml
---
name: data-analyzer
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
---

You analyze large datasets over extended periods.
Process data systematically and maintain detailed progress tracking.
```

```bash
# Configure for long-running analysis
export MAX_STEPS=2000
export COMPACTION_THRESHOLD=0.8
export COMPACTION_KEEP_RECENT=5

# Run the agent
agentuse run data-analyzer.agentuse
```

The agent will automatically:
- Track token usage throughout the analysis
- Compact context when approaching 80% of the model's limit
- Preserve the last 5 messages for continuity
- Continue analysis without interruption
