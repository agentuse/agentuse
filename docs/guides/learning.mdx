## What is Learning?

Learning extracts insights from agent executions and stores them in a readable markdown file. You can then review these learnings and incorporate the best ones back into your agent instructions - creating a human-in-the-loop improvement cycle.

## Recommended Workflow

The default workflow keeps you in control:

1. **Enable extraction** - Set `evaluate: true` to capture learnings
2. **Run your agent** - Learnings accumulate in `{agent-name}.learnings.md`
3. **Review periodically** - Check the learnings file for valuable insights
4. **Update instructions** - Copy the best learnings into your agent file

```yaml
---
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
learning:
  evaluate: true   # Extract learnings after execution
  apply: false     # Review manually (default)
---

# Blog Writer

Write short productivity blog posts.

## Guidelines
- Start with a relatable hook
- Include 3 actionable tips
```

After several runs, check `blog-writer.learnings.md`. If you see a valuable pattern like "use specific time estimates for each tip", add it to your Guidelines section permanently.

## Auto-Apply (Optional)

If you want hands-off improvement, enable `apply: true`:

```yaml
learning:
  evaluate: true
  apply: true      # Automatically inject learnings
```

With auto-apply:
- Up to 10 learnings are appended to your agent instructions each run
- The agent adapts without manual intervention
- Less control, but more autonomous

<Note>
  Start with manual review (`apply: false`) until you trust the quality of extracted learnings. Then consider enabling auto-apply for mature agents.
</Note>

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `evaluate` | `true` or `string` | Extract learnings after execution. Use `true` or a custom evaluation prompt. |
| `apply` | `boolean` | Auto-inject stored learnings in future runs. Default: `false`. |
| `file` | `string` | Custom file path for storing learnings (relative to agent file). |

## Storage

Learnings are stored in `{agent-name}.learnings.md` next to your agent file:

```
my-project/
  blog-writer.agentuse
  blog-writer.learnings.md   # Auto-created, human-readable
```

Custom path:

```yaml
learning:
  evaluate: true
  file: "./learnings/shared.md"
```

## How Extraction Works

After execution (when `evaluate: true`):

1. LLM evaluates the execution result
2. Extracts 0-3 high-confidence learnings (≥0.8 threshold)
3. Deduplicates against existing learnings (60% word overlap)
4. Stores in markdown format

## How Application Works

On next run (when `apply: true`):

1. Loads up to 10 learnings from storage
2. Appends them to your agent instructions as a `## Learned Guidelines` section
3. Tracks which learnings were applied (for analytics)

This keeps learnings at the instruction level - where they have the most influence on agent behavior.

## Learning Categories

Learnings are categorized for context:

- **tip** - General best practices
- **warning** - Things to avoid
- **pattern** - Successful approaches
- **tool-usage** - How to use specific tools
- **error-fix** - Solutions to known errors

## Storage Format

Learnings are stored as readable markdown:

```markdown
# Learnings for blog-writer

### [tip] Use specific examples over generic advice
<!-- id:a1b2c3d4 | confidence:0.92 | applied:3 | 2026-01-27 -->
When writing productivity tips, include concrete scenarios
like "checking emails before coffee" rather than abstract advice.

### [pattern] Structure with time estimates
<!-- id:e5f6g7h8 | confidence:0.88 | applied:1 | 2026-01-27 -->
Each actionable tip should include a specific time estimate
(e.g., "5-minute brain dump") to make it feel achievable.
```

## Custom Evaluation Prompts

Pass a string to `evaluate` for domain-specific extraction:

```yaml
learning:
  evaluate: |
    Evaluate the blog post against these criteria:
    1. Hook quality - Is the opening engaging?
    2. Actionability - Can readers implement immediately?
    3. Tone - Professional but conversational?
```

## Example: Manual Review Workflow

```yaml
---
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
learning:
  evaluate: true
---

# Blog Writer

Write short productivity blog posts (150-200 words).

## Requirements
- Start with a relatable hook
- Include 3 actionable tips
- End with a clear call-to-action
```

After 5-10 runs, review `blog-writer.learnings.md`:

```markdown
### [tip] Use specific examples over generic advice
When writing productivity tips, include concrete scenarios
like "checking emails before coffee" rather than abstract advice.

### [pattern] Structure with time estimates
Each actionable tip should include a specific time estimate
(e.g., "5-minute brain dump") to make it feel achievable.
```

Then update your agent instructions with the best insights:

```yaml
## Requirements
- Start with a relatable hook
- Include 3 actionable tips with specific time estimates  # ← from learnings
- Use concrete scenarios, not abstract advice             # ← from learnings
- End with a clear call-to-action
```

This keeps you in control while still benefiting from extracted patterns.
