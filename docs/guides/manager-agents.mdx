  **Experimental Feature**: Manager agents are experimental. The configuration and behavior may change or be removed in future versions. Discuss feedback in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/agentuse/agentuse/discussions).

## What are Manager Agents?

Manager agents are specialized agents designed for orchestration. Instead of doing work directly, they coordinate teams of subagents, track progress, and make decisions about what work to delegate next.


## When to Use Manager Agents

Use a manager agent when you need to:

- **Coordinate multiple specialists** - Different agents for research, writing, review, etc.
- **Track complex workflows** - Multi-phase projects with dependencies
- **Run scheduled operations** - Regular tasks that span multiple runs
- **Maintain state across runs** - Track what's done, what's pending, what's blocked

## Basic Configuration

Set `type: manager` in your agent frontmatter:

```yaml
---
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
type: manager
subagents:
  - path: ./researcher.agentuse
  - path: ./writer.agentuse
---

# Content Manager

## Goal
Create articles on trending topics.

## SOP
1. Research trending topics
2. Write articles for each topic
3. Review and publish
```

## Configuration Options

### Required
- `type: manager` - Enables manager mode with orchestration prompts

### Recommended
- `subagents` - Team of agents to delegate to
- `store` - Persistent storage for tracking work items

### Optional
- `schedule` - Cron expression for scheduled runs

## The Manager Prompt

When `type: manager` is set, your agent automatically receives instructions with orchestration guidelines. You don't need to write these yourself - they're included automatically.

### Automatic Orchestration Loop

The manager follows this loop automatically (shown for reference - you don't need to include this in your agent file):

1. **UNDERSTAND** - Parse goal and SOP from your instructions
2. **CHECK** - Review current state (pending work, in-progress items)
3. **DECIDE** - Determine what needs to happen next based on goal and state
4. **DELEGATE** - Call subagents with clear, specific instructions
5. **TRACK** - Update store items with outcomes from delegation
6. **REPEAT** - Continue until the goal is achieved or no further progress can be made

This means you only need to define your **Goal** and **SOP** - the manager handles the orchestration mechanics.

### Schedule Awareness
If your manager has a `schedule`, it receives context about run frequency:

```yaml
---
type: manager
schedule: "0 9 * * *"  # Daily at 9 AM
---
```

The manager learns to pace work appropriately - not rushing to complete everything in one run if there's time, checking progress vs targets before starting new work.

## Work Tracking with Store

Managers work best with a persistent store:

```yaml
---
type: manager
store: "my-project"  # Shared store name
subagents:
  - path: ./researcher.agentuse
  - path: ./writer.agentuse
---
```

<Note>
  All subagents can share the same store by using the same store name. This enables coordination without explicit communication.
</Note>

See [Store Guide](/guides/store) for available store tools.

## Writing SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

A good SOP clearly defines the workflow phases:

```markdown
## SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)

### Phase 1: Research
- Use the researcher to find 3 interesting topics
- Store each topic with type "topic" and status "pending"

### Phase 2: Writing
- For each pending topic, delegate to the writer
- Update status to "in_progress" when started
- Update status to "written" when complete

### Phase 3: Review
- For each written article, delegate to the reviewer
- If approved, update status to "done"
- If revisions needed, send back to writer

### Completion
- All items should have status "done"
- Summarize completed work
```

## Complete Example: Content Team

### Manager Agent

```yaml
# manager.agentuse
---
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
type: manager
store: "content-pipeline"
schedule: "0 * * * *"  # Every hour
subagents:
  - path: ./agents/researcher.agentuse
  - path: ./agents/writer.agentuse
  - path: ./agents/reviewer.agentuse
---

# Content Team Manager

## Goal
Produce 3 high-quality articles per day.

## SOP

### Phase 1: Topic Discovery
- Check store for pending topics
- If fewer than 3 pending topics, use researcher to find more
- Store topics with type "topic", status "pending"

### Phase 2: Writing
- For each pending topic, delegate to writer
- Pass topic context and target word count (500 words)
- Store article with type "article", parentId = topic id

### Phase 3: Review
- For each unreviewed article, delegate to reviewer
- If approved, mark article as "done"
- If revisions needed, mark as "needs_revision" with feedback

### Completion Criteria
- 3 articles with status "done" today
- Report progress and any blockers
```

### Researcher Subagent

```yaml
# agents/researcher.agentuse
---
model: anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5
store: "content-pipeline"
---

You are a research specialist. Find trending topics.

When given a research task:
1. Search for trending topics in the specified area
2. Evaluate each topic for article potential
3. Create store items for promising topics

Return a summary of topics found.
```

### Writer Subagent

```yaml
# agents/writer.agentuse
---
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
store: "content-pipeline"
---

You are a content writer. Create engaging articles.

When given a writing task:
1. Get the topic from the store using the provided ID
2. Research and write a compelling article
3. Create a store item for the article linked to the topic
4. Update the topic status to "written"

Return the completed article.
```

### Reviewer Subagent

```yaml
# agents/reviewer.agentuse
---
model: anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5
store: "content-pipeline"
---

You are an editor. Review articles for quality.

When given a review task:
1. Get the article from the store
2. Check for: accuracy, clarity, engagement, grammar
3. Either approve (update status to "done") or request revisions

Return your review decision with feedback.
```

## Delegation Guidelines

When managers delegate to subagents:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Provide Clear Instructions">
    Be specific about what you need. Include context from previous work.
    ```
    writer({
      task: "Write a 500-word article about AI productivity tools",
      context: { topicId: "...", keywords: [...], targetAudience: "..." }
    })
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pass Store Item IDs">
    So subagents can update the same items:
    ```
    reviewer({
      task: "Review article for publication",
      context: { articleId: "01HX...", topicId: "01HW..." }
    })
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set Clear Expectations">
    What output do you expect? What quality bar?
    ```
    task: "Write article. Must include: 3 actionable tips, real examples, conclusion with CTA"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Handling Blockers

Managers should stop and report when blocked:

```markdown
## When Blocked

If I need human input, I will:
1. State what I'm blocked on
2. Explain what decision/input I need
3. List available options if applicable

Example blockers:
- Need approval for topic selection
- External resource required (API key, credentials)
- Quality issue that requires human judgment
```

## Debugging Manager Agents

### Enable Verbose Logging
```bash
agentuse run manager.agentuse --verbose
```

### Check Store State
```bash
# View store contents
cat .agentuse/store/content-pipeline/items.json | jq
```

### Test Subagents Independently
```bash
# Run subagent directly
agentuse run ./agents/writer.agentuse "Write about AI tools"
```
