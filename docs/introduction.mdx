## Autonomous Agents That Work Without You

**AgentUse** is a CLI framework for building autonomous AI agents. Define agents in markdown, run via cron, CI/CD, or serverless, and get results without babysitting. No SDK. No flowcharts. Just AI that works while you don't.

## Why AgentUse?

### The Problem

AI tools today force you to choose:
- **Interactive copilots** require your constant attention - great for pair programming, but can't run unattended
- **Visual workflow tools** give you drag-and-drop simplicity but create version control nightmares and vendor lock-in
- **SDK-heavy frameworks** offer power but require hundreds of lines of boilerplate just to say "hello world"

### The Solution

AgentUse creates autonomous agents that work without you. Define agents in markdown, run via cron, CI/CD, or serverless, and get results asynchronously.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Runs Unattended">
    Run via cron jobs, CI/CD pipelines, and serverless functions. No babysitting required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version Control Just Works">
    Diff, review, and merge agents like any other code. Your agents are text files that integrate seamlessly with Git.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No SDK Required">
    If you can write plain English, you can build an agent. No new syntax or programming required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Production Ready">
    Built-in retries, streaming, error recovery, and MCP support. Sub-second startup times.
  </Accordion>

## Try It Now

No API keys needed - run this to see AgentUse in action:

```bash
npx -y agentuse@latest run https://agentuse.io/hello.agentuse
```

## How It Works

AgentUse agents are markdown files with YAML configuration and plain English instructions:

```yaml
---
model: anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5
---

You are a helpful assistant.

## Task
Say hello to the user and ask how you can help them today.
```

That's it! Save this as `hello.agentuse` and run:

```bash
npx -y agentuse@latest run hello.agentuse
```

The agent name is automatically derived from the filename, keeping configuration minimal.
