## AI Agents as Simple as Markdown

**AgentUse** is a minimal-configuration CLI that lets you build production AI agents with just markdown files. Inspired by Claude Code's elegant markdown-based configuration, AgentUse takes this philosophy further - your entire agent *is* a markdown file. Just set your API key and start building.

## Why AgentUse?

### The Problem

Current agent frameworks force an impossible choice:
- **Visual workflow tools** give you drag-and-drop simplicity but create version control nightmares and vendor lock-in
- **Traditional code frameworks** offer power and flexibility but require hundreds of lines of boilerplate just to say "hello world"

### The Solution

AgentUse makes your agents *just markdown files*. Not configuration files that generate code. Not visual flows that compile to JSON. The markdown IS the agent.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version Control Just Works">
    Diff, review, and merge agents like any other code. Your agents are text files that integrate seamlessly with Git.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Share Agents with a URL">
    As easy as sharing a gist. Agents can even be run directly from HTTPS URLs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Zero Learning Curve">
    If you can write a README, you can build an agent. No new syntax to learn.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Production Ready">
    Built-in retries, streaming, error recovery, and MCP support. Sub-second startup times.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Features

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fast Startup">
    Run agents quickly with minimal overhead. Sub-second startup times for rapid deployment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-Provider Support">
    Works with Anthropic Claude (including OAuth), OpenAI GPT, and OpenRouter with flexible API key management.
  </Step>
  <Step title="MCP Integration">
    Connect to any Model Context Protocol server for database, filesystem, and API access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sub-Agent Support">
    Build complex workflows by composing multiple specialized agents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

AgentUse agents are defined using a simple markdown format with minimal configuration:

```yaml
---
model: anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-latest
---

You are a helpful assistant.

## Task
Say hello to the user and ask how you can help them today.
```

That's it! Save this as `hello.agentuse` and run:

```bash
agentuse run hello.agentuse
```

The agent name is automatically derived from the filename, keeping configuration minimal.

## What Can You Build?
